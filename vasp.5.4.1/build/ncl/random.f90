!
! This random number generator originally appeared in Toward a Universal
! Random Number Generator by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman.
! Florida State University Report: FSU-SCRI-87-50 (1987)
!
! It was later modified by F. James and published in A Review of Pseudo-
! random Number Generators
!
! Some final small modifications have been 1._q by J. Furthmueller
! Technical University of Vienna, November 1993
!
! THIS IS THE BEST KNOWN RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR AVAILABLE.
!       (However, a newly discovered technique can yield
!         a period of 10^600. But that is still in the development stage.)
!
! It passes ALL of the tests for random number generators and has a period
!   of 2^144, is completely portable (gives bit identical results on all
!   machines with at least 24-bit mantissas in the floating point
!   representation).
!
! The algorithm is a combination of a Fibonacci sequence (with lags of 97
!   and 33, and operation "subtraction plus (1._q,0._q), modulo (1._q,0._q)") and an
!   "arithmetic sequence" (using subtraction).
!
! On a Vax 11/780, this random number generator can produce a number in
!    13 microseconds.
! (Note by J. Furthmueller: in 2.5 microseconds on a IBM RS6000/Model 580)

! The random number sequences created by these two seeds are of sufficient
! length to complete an entire calculation with. For example, if several
! different groups are working on different parts of the same calculation,
! each group could be assigned its own IJ seed. This would leave each group
! with 30000 choices for the second seed. That is to say, this random

! Use IJ = 1802 & KL = 9373 to test the random number generator. The
