This directory contains a set of programs for generating Ramirez and
Bohm style K-point sets.  These programs were written by John
Mitchell, I have made slight modifications to remove a couple of
crashing bugs and to have them generate output files that can be used
with bind.  I have not made any other modifications to the code.

I'm distributing these programs along with YAeHMOP as a service to users,
I am not supporting them and I cannot guarantee their correctness.
The program kpointer describes the programs.

All programs produce a file called kout which contains the K-points
and weights.  This file can be inserted directly into a bind input
file.
